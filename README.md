List of Total war Shogun 2 Mods I used to make gameplay 2x better

Tools : 
Pack file manager (PFM): To edit or create mods for Total war games that use .pack extension
EditSF : To edit save files . 
ModManager: To manage the load order of mods .

Edited_mods folder contains mods that I have heavily edited for which changes are written below. 
Unedited_mods folder contains mods that I haven't changed at all after downloading from steamworkshop. 

Note: First Download Darthmods Full Version and Launcher from moddb as it contains some amazing visual mods . Those mods are large sized so i can't upload it here.
The only file i've changed in darthmod is "darthmod_shogun.pack". So, other settings are your personal wish. 

About Darthmod : It's an amazing top-tier mod that enhances AI and CAI (campaign map's AI) and buffs up many other features of the game like unit stats, morale , Units size ,etc to make Gameplay last long (way too long) and have large-scale battles from the start. It also removes AI cheating to give you false sense of difficulty at Higher difficulty settings (which I hate) . It add many new changes to unit visuals and unit cards which looks way better than original.
